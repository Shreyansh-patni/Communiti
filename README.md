# 🧩 Communiti: Build, Learn, Launch — Together

> A digital ecosystem where entrepreneurs, tech enthusiasts, and UI/UX designers collaborate, solve challenges, and launch their ideas.

---

## 🚀 Inspiration

We’ve always believed in the power of *communities* — not just social spaces, but high-impact, solution-driven groups where minds converge to **build**, **learn**, and **launch** meaningful projects. The Bolt Hackathon was a perfect reason to finally bring this vision to life.

## 💡 What It Does

**Communiti** connects aspiring entrepreneurs and tech creators through:

* 💬 **Domain-based Communities** (Business, Tech, Design)
* 🤖 **AI Assistant** for business guidance
* 🎤 **Live Events & Webinars** (hosted by community admins)
* 📌 **Discussion Boards** for collaboration
* 🧪 **MVP Launch Support** tools

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

**Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore) + Node.js (optional endpoints)
**AI Integration**: OpenAI API for Assistant
**Deployment**: Netlify + Entri custom domain
**Error Monitoring**: Sentry
**Design & Mockups**: Pica + Figma
